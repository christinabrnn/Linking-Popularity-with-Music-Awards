# Linking-Popularity-with-Music-Awards

As success in the music industry is multifaceted, involving a blend of streaming popularity, critical recognition, and commercial certification. By identifying the factors that contribute to a song’s success—such as high Spotify play counts, Grammy wins, or RIAA certifications—we can equip artists, record labels, and marketers with actionable insights. This analysis will focus on the extent to which streaming metrics correlate with accolades and certifications, offering a strategic foundation for data-driven promotion and investment decisions. Moreover, by applying business analytics tools, this project aims to uncover the nuanced dynamics behind what resonates with audiences and achieves industry recognition, offering stakeholders a roadmap to navigating an increasingly data-oriented music landscape.
